Let's build a movie-focused system from scratch:

## 1. Movie Database Schema## 2. Movie Edge Function## 3. Setup Guide for Movie System## 4. Movie API ClientPerfect! I've created a complete movie-focused system that's much better architectured for handling different media types. Here's what we've built:

## ðŸŽ¬ **New Movie System Overview**

### **1. Dedicated Movie Database Schema**
- **`movies`** table with movie-specific fields (director, runtime, genres, MPAA rating, etc.)
- **`movie_watches`** table for tracking when you watched movies and your ratings/reviews
- **`movie_people`** table for cast and crew (optional, for rich data)
- **`movie_lists`** table for collections/watchlists

### **2. Movie-Specific Edge Function**
- Handles EchoFeed webhooks specifically for movie RSS feeds
- Supports multiple sources: **Letterboxd**, **Trakt.tv**, and generic movie feeds
- Intelligent parsing to extract movie title, year, rating, and review from different feed formats
- Proper deduplication using external IDs and title/year matching

### **3. EchoFeed Integration**
- Designed specifically for [EchoFeed's webhook format](https://help.echofeed.app/services/)
- EchoFeed monitors your movie RSS feeds (Letterboxd, Trakt.tv) and sends webhooks when you rate/review movies
- No more manual backfilling - automatically captures new activity!

### **4. Rich API Client**
- JavaScript client with methods for building movie websites
- Dashboard data, stats, search, top-rated movies, watching streaks
- Ready-to-use HTML generators for widgets

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the movie system:**
   ```bash
   # Run the movie schema SQL in Supabase
   # Deploy the movie edge function
   supabase functions new movies
   supabase functions deploy movies --no-verify-jwt
   ```

2. **Set up EchoFeed:**
   - Sign up at [echofeed.app](https://echofeed.app)
   - Add your Letterboxd RSS feed: `https://letterboxd.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rss/`
   - Point webhook to: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/movies`

3. **Test by rating a movie on Letterboxd** - should automatically appear in your database!

4. **Build your movie website** using the API client

## ðŸ”® **Future Media Types**

This approach sets us up perfectly to add:
- **TV Shows** â†’ `tv_shows` + `tv_watches` tables + dedicated function
- **Books** â†’ `books` + `book_reads` tables + Goodreads integration  
- **Games** â†’ `games` + `game_sessions` tables + Steam integration
- **Music** â†’ `albums` + `listens` tables + Last.fm integration

Each gets its own specialized schema and function, but all follow the same webhook pattern.
